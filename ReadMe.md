This GitHub provides a space to share applications that I have written.  I am interested in sharing ideas and learning the craft of data science.  I am currently writing a book on "Theory Driven Data Science" and am using this GitHub to collect some of the material for my book.

See the [Theory Driven Data Science](target = "blank" https://TheoryDrivenDataScience.com) web site for more information on the book project.

The HowBig project is a calculator for determining the R Squared produced by N variables in a regression model with a fixed r value between the X variables and Y.  This was initially set up as a test to see how many variables it takes to achieve an R Squared equal to 1.000.  I added some functionality to look at how the big data Vs (volume, veracity, variety) affect prediction accuracy.

The SlowChangeMethod project raises the possibility that slow change is more effective that fast change.  This is based on research on longitudinal sets of criminal offender risk scores. The data suggests that fast change is related to poorer outcomes.

The TheoryMethodPractice project is a placeholder for future work related to the Theory Driven Data Science.

The 52WeeksofDataPatternAnalysis project is a weekly series that I am posting on my LinkedIn profile.  This work is an attempt to collect and organize the work from several discoveries I have made.

Any input is welcome.  This is a work in progress and feedback is needed.
